# karp - universal app launcher

Deprecated. Recommended to shim `open` by configuring the relevant shell accordingly.

A few examples are available for some of the ultra common environments:

* macOS and other BSD's often include a builtin [open](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=open&sektion=1) command baked into the base operating system.
* [Linux (X11)](https://github.com/mcandre/dotfiles/blob/master/.profile.d/open.x11.sh)
* [Windows (cmd.exe)](https://github.com/mcandre/dotfiles/blob/master/open.cmd)
* [Windows (PowerShell)](https://github.com/mcandre/dotfiles/blob/master/profile.ps1)

More fringe environments like fish, ion, rc, etc. should consult their shell + operating system documentation.
